# Apple Music CLI Player

> Modified version of [Apple Music CLI Player](https://github.com/mcthomas/Apple-Music-CLI-Player), display changes and made compatible with Bash.
>
> _Original from [Matt Thomas](https://github.com/mcthomas)._

*Tested on macOS 12 & 13 (likely to work on macOS 10.15, 11). **Can be called with the system default zsh.** I recommend aliasing am.sh to `alias am=bash path/to/am.sh`, or moving its three individual functions into your .zshrc.*

**Goal:** Provide a simple command-line interface to listing out, playing songs from, and utilizing controls for Music.app.  I decided against using a library such as ncurses to build a full TUI application, as I think it is preferable to interface via quick commands and a light "widget".

## Now Playing (np)

Enjoy a simple "Now Playing" widget from your terminal.  Uses standard Unix tooling/piping, AppleScript for interfacing with Apple Music, and [Viu](https://github.com/atanunq/viu) for displaying the album art images.  It also includes keyboard shortcut bindings for basic playback controls.  Apart from toggling shuffle, toggling repeat, and changing the Music.app-specific volume, the other controls are already accessible from the special Fn key functions/touch bar.  

Dependencies: [Viu](https://github.com/atanunq/viu) (unless you always use text mode)

Configuration: 

* Place album-art.applescript at ~/Library/Scripts/album-art.applescript, or configure a valid path in the np() func of am.sh for wherever you decide to keep it
* (Optional) In the np() func of am.sh, adjust the `-h` dimension of the album art (look for the two calls to `viu`) to ensure a square appearance with your terminal emulator's line spacing

Usage (aliased): `am np`

Usage (not aliased): `bash am.sh np`
```
np                    Open the "Now Playing" TUI widget.
                      (Music.app track must be actively
		      playing or paused)
np -t		      Open in text mode (disables album art)

np keybindings:

p                     Play / Pause
f                     Forward one track
b                     Backward one track
>                     Begin fast forwarding current track
<                     Begin rewinding current track
R                     Resume normal playback
+                     Increase Music.app volume 5%
-                     Decrease Music.app volume 5%
s                     Toggle shuffle
r                     Toggle song repeat
q                     Quit np
Q                     Quit np and Music.app
?                     Show / hide keybindings
```

Notes: 
* Attempting to play the previous track with an empty queue will kill the script
* album-art.applescript is a modified version of [this script,](https://dougscripts.com/itunes/2014/10/save-current-tracks-artwork/) written by AppleScript wizard [Doug Adams](https://dougscripts.com/itunes/faq_cont.php)♡

## List

List out all song groupings of a specific type or all songs of a specific song grouping in your library.  The song grouping type is dictated by the flag you pass. By calling list without specifying a title after the flag, you will see a printout of all the titles of that flag's collection type. 

Usage (aliased): `am list [-grouping] [name]`

Usage (not aliased): `bash am.sh list [-grouping] [name]`
```
list -s               List all songs in your library.
list -r               List all records.
list -r PATTERN       List all songs in the record PATTERN.
list -a               List all artists.
list -a PATTERN       List all songs by the artist PATTERN.
list -p               List all playlists.
list -p PATTERN       List all songs in the playlist PATTERN.
list -g               List all genres.
list -g PATTERN       List all songs in the genre PATTERN.
```
Example: `am list -r In Rainbows` (not case-sensitive)

Notes: 
* Music.app does not need to be open or closed; it should launch itself silently when `list` is called
* Only works on tracks saved to your Library (but they do not need to be downloaded)
* Remember to escape any special characters or punctuation if passing a title (or wrap it in double quotes)

## Play

Begin playback of different song groupings or a specific song grouping in your library. The song grouping type is dictated by the flag you pass.  By calling play without specifying a title after the flag, you are prompted to select a title of that flag's collection type on the fly via [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). Unfortunately there is no simple way to play, for example, a specific album or songs from a specific artist with AppleScript, but I was able to modify code shared by a "jccc" [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1053355), as a workaround which involves automatically creating a single temporary playlist in your library that is utilized by play().

Dependencies: [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (unless you always play groupings by name)

Usage (aliased): `am play [-grouping] [name]`

Usage (not aliased): `zsh am.sh play [-grouping] [name]`
```
play -s               Fzf for a song and begin playback.
play -s PATTERN       Play the song PATTERN.
play -r               Fzf for a record and begin playback.
play -r PATTERN       Play from the record PATTERN.
play -a               Fzf for an artist and begin playback.
play -a PATTERN       Play from the artist PATTERN.
play -p               Fzf for a playlist and begin playback.
play -p PATTERN       Play from the playlist PATTERN.
play -g               Fzf for a genre and begin playback.
play -g PATTERN       Play from the genre PATTERN.
play -l               Play from your entire library.
```
Example: `am play -a Radiohead` (not case-sensitive)

Notes: 
* Music.app does not need to be open or closed; it should launch itself silently when `play` is called
* Only works on tracks saved to your Library (but they do not need to be downloaded)
* Remember to escape any special characters or punctuation if passing a title (or wrap it in double quotes)
* calling `-p Library` will result in quite a delay, unlike `-l`, because it requires copying all the songs in your library into the temporary playlist

### Optional AirPlay Snippet (not in src)

Toggle the Music.app AirPlay audio output for a specific device. 

Configuration: 
* Adjust the device strings to a device hostname of your choosing
* Ideally adapt the argument name to match

```
if [ $1 = "atv" ]
   then
    isActive=$(osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to get selected of AirPlay device "Apple TV"')
    if [ $isActive = 'false' ]
    then
      osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to set selected of AirPlay device "Apple TV" to true'
    else
      osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to set selected of AirPlay device "Apple TV" to false'
  fi
fi
```
Example: `bash ap.sh atv`

### Known Problems

- Error: `execution error: Music got an error: Application isn’t running. (-600)`
  - Solution: Reboot. It seems to occur occasionally after having had Music.app open for too long while your Mac has slept. Other potential solutions can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19957268/applescript-fails-with-error-600-when-launched-over-ssh-on-mavericks)
- Blinking for each output refresh when running np()
  - Consider using a lighter-weight terminal emulator, or even Terminal.app, where this doesn't seem to occur. I am not sure how to mitigate this for heavier terminal emulators such as iTerm2

### Ideas For Improvement

* am.sh could be expanded with a function to call new AppleScript snippets to create, delete, or refine playlists; it would also be nice to be able to queue (as apposed to immediately play) a song or a group of songs, which is possible (though there is no native corresponding AppleScript function to accomplish this at present)
* This project could be forked and used in the backend to create a full client alternative to Music.app, though it would not be possible to browse for and save tracks outside of the user's library
* See the Script Editor.app's dictionary API (Music.sdef) for an exhaustive reference of all the native Music.app variables and functions that can be interfaced via AppleScript
